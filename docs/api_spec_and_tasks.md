## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the application. Initializes Flask and routes."),
    ("uniswap.py", "Contains the Uniswap class. This class is responsible for interacting with the Uniswap API."),
    ("calculator.py", "Contains the Calculator class. This class is responsible for calculating APY and ROI."),
    ("templates/index.html", "Contains the HTML for the main page of the application."),
    ("static/css/main.css", "Contains the CSS for the main page of the application."),
    ("Dockerfile", "Contains the instructions for building the Docker image."),
    ("requirements.txt", "Contains the list of Python packages required for the application.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "requirements.txt",
    "uniswap.py",
    "calculator.py",
    "main.py",
    "templates/index.html",
    "static/css/main.css",
    "Dockerfile"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'uniswap.py' contains the Uniswap class which is responsible for interacting with the Uniswap API. It has a method 'get_pool_data' which takes a pool_id as parameter and returns the pool data.

'calculator.py' contains the Calculator class which is responsible for calculating APY and ROI. It has a method 'calculate_apy_roi' which takes pool_data and price_range as parameters and returns the calculated APY and ROI.

'main.py' is the main entry point for the application. It initializes Flask and routes.

'templates/index.html' and 'static/css/main.css' are responsible for the frontend of the application.

'Dockerfile' contains the instructions for building the Docker image which is used for deploying the application.

```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, we need to ensure that all team members understand the Uniswap V3 formula and how to implement it in our system. We also need to ensure that all team members are familiar with Docker and how to use it for deployment.
