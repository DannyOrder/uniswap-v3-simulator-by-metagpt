## Original Requirements
The boss wants to establish a simulation website for Uniswap V3. The website should allow users to select from all the trading pools on Uniswap. Users should be able to set price range rules (e.g., current price*100.1% = upper range, current price*99.9% = lower range). After setting, the website will retrieve information from Uniswap V3, and calculate APY / ROI and other information according to the price range setting, Uniswap v3 formula, and specified time period.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a simulation website for Uniswap V3 with user-friendly interface",
    "Enable users to select from all trading pools on Uniswap and set price range rules",
    "Retrieve information from Uniswap V3 and calculate APY / ROI based on user settings"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to select from all trading pools on Uniswap, so that I can choose the one that suits me best",
    "As a user, I want to set price range rules, so that I can manage my investments more effectively",
    "As a user, I want the website to retrieve information from Uniswap V3, so that I can get the most accurate data",
    "As a user, I want the website to calculate APY / ROI based on my settings, so that I can make informed investment decisions",
    "As a user, I want a user-friendly interface, so that I can easily navigate the website"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Uniswap Interface: Official interface for Uniswap, but lacks simulation functionality",
    "Sushiswap: Another decentralized exchange, offers similar functionality but not specific to Uniswap",
    "Zapper.fi: Offers a dashboard for DeFi investments, but lacks simulation functionality",
    "DeBank: Offers a DeFi wallet and portfolio tracker, but lacks simulation functionality",
    "Zerion: Offers a DeFi investment interface, but lacks simulation functionality",
    "Balancer: Another decentralized exchange, offers similar functionality but not specific to Uniswap",
    "Curve Finance: Another decentralized exchange, offers similar functionality but not specific to Uniswap"

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a web-based application that simulates Uniswap V3. It should allow users to select from all trading pools on Uniswap and set price range rules. It should retrieve information from Uniswap V3 and calculate APY / ROI based on user settings. The interface should be user-friendly.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Implement a user-friendly interface", "P0"),
    ("Enable users to select from all trading pools on Uniswap", "P0"),
    ("Allow users to set price range rules", "P0"),
    ("Retrieve information from Uniswap V3", "P0"),
    ("Calculate APY / ROI based on user settings", "P0")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The website should have a clean and intuitive design. The main page should display a list of all trading pools on Uniswap for users to select. There should be a section for users to set price range rules. Once the settings are complete, the website should display the retrieved information from Uniswap V3 and the calculated APY / ROI.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
